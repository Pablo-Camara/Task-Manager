## Task Manager (under development)

This is a basic task manager which I created to add another project to my list of projects and also, obviously, to gain some more experience.

I decided to make it open source to share a bit of my way of doing things.

- For the frontend I've decided to use mostly pure vanilla javascript for this
- For the backend Laravel 9 (PHP)

### Main Features so far
- Allow creating folders
- Allow creating tasks inside folders
- Also allow creating folders inside folders
- Allow Editing/Removing/Moving tasks and folders
- Play/Pause button to record amount of time working on a task
- Allow marking tasks as different status (completed, on hold, deprecated, etc..)
